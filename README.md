# VSCO downloader Telegram bot

Running instance can be found at [@VSCOdownloader_bot](https://t.me/VSCOdownloader_bot).

## Usage
If you don't want to use my running instance but reuse the code for a different Telegram bot, clone the repo and add your bot's token to `credentials/credentials.py`.

Then you will be able to run it doing:
```python 3
python run.py
```
